# DEVBOARD

A custom devboard I made as a part of PROTOTYPE for HackClub.

Here are the parts I'm using,

1. USB-C port
2. Flash Memory
3. Crystal Oscillator
4. 1/0 Headers
5. RP2040
6. RGB Light
7. Custom Silk Screen

Rerouting, Adding details, and Ordering
I moved many of the routes to eliminate most of the warnings on my PCB and did extensive research on each error that appeared. I added a detail using the image converter, generated the Gerber and CSV files, uploaded them to JLCPCB, and started the ordering process. I had to change some parts because of what they had in stock, but my research says they should be equivalent.

Fixed the ts PCB and recreated it twice
Thanks to some hard drive issues, my KiCAD wasn't saving. So I re-created the whole thing, turned off my PC, then the next day logged on to finish it, and it was gone AGAIN! I replaced my hard drive, and KiCAD is working now. Thanks to that, I finally finished creating this PCB, and there aren't any errors. Now I get to add art to it!

With this newest iteration, I moved and changed many components after redoing this project twice, so I could route it as quickly as possible. It's safe to say I'm comfortable with KiCAD after this wholeexperiencee

created and routed the PCB
I placed all the electronics and routed them according to the schematic. Next, I'll test whether the PCB is functional and add art to it. I'll have to give it some thought, though. I've got some ideas for the art I'll add. And of course, Hack Club is gonna be one of said things.

Created Schematic
Just finished creating the schematic for the Dev Board. I followed the guide step by step and reviewed it for the finished product. Now I'm ready to move on to creating the PCB. I'm starting to dread the routing part though...
